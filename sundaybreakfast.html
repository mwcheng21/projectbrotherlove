											<h3>Who we are</h3>
										</header>
										<p style="color: black;">
Founded in 1878, we have reached out to the homeless in Philadelphia for more than 140 years. Originally named the Sunday Breakfast Association, our name was changed a few years ago to reflect our expanded services as a Rescue Mission. Rescue Missions are similar to a traditional homeless shelter, but focus on caring for the spiritual needs in addition to the practical needs of people.

Sunday Breakfast Rescue Mission serves those experiencing homelessness in Philadelphia.  The Mission offers an array of homeless day services and clinics to men and women.  Additionally, the Mission has a 30- day menâ€™s emergency shelter, offers a 12 month transitional housing program to men, and a permanent supportive housing program for men 65 years of age and older.  The Mission relies on the generous contributions of caring individuals, families, churches and businesses.
