        <p><a href="whosoever.html">Whosoever Gospel Mission</a></p>
      Heather Rice, a native of Philadelphia, is the Associate Executive Director of the Whosoever Gospel Mission where she has served in various capacities sharing the love of Christ with homeless men in the historic Germantown neighborhood for 28 years (since she was a freshman at Central High School).  
<br>
<br>
Heather is a graduate of Cairn University, holds a Master of Arts degree in Counseling from Westminster Theological Seminary and a Doctor of Ministry degree in urban mission from Biblical Theological Seminary (now Missio Seminary). The focus of her doctoral project is helping homeless men build healthy relationships with their children.
<br>
<br>
Though she has known Jesus from a very young age and was raised in a wonderful, Christian family, she didn’t really begin to understand God’s grace until coming to the Mission.  She’s passionate about helping others find and drink deeply of that same grace in Christ through her relationships, her work at the Mission, and her preaching and teaching ministry throughout the Greater Philadelphia area (including at First Pres’ neighbor church, Bridgeport Pres). Heather lives in Philadelphia with her cat, Pickles, and loves gardening, traveling, and spending time with her friends and family.
