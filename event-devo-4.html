Life is not a competition to see who can be good or better. Life is not even about us at all. We all like boasting about how good we are at something and it feels good when people acknowledge that. But this universe was created so that God could brag (in a good way) and that we could brag about what He’s done.

      <li>When you do something good, do you brag about it?
</li>
      <li>
        Do you make sure someone else knows?</li>
      <li>If it’s not about us, then what's the point of doing good works at all?</li>
