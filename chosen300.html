											<h3>Who we are</h3>
										</header>
										<p style="color: black;">
											Chosen 300's mission is to bring people of different membership groups together; helping them to realize that despite our differences in our race, ethnic group, denomination, social class, economic classes, or the diverse ways we practice our faith; we can unify ourselves for the common good. The purpose of our unification is to distribute meals and services to the homeless throughout the Philadelphia Region and around the world. 										</p>
										<p style="color: black;">
											Chosen 300 began in 1995, the vision was to bring Christians of different denominations and backgrounds together for a one-night prayer service. On September 29, 1995, Executive Director Brian Jenkins along with the Zion Prayer Band of Ardmore held an all night worship and prayer service from 10:00 PM till 4:00 AM. The service was based around the theme of Gideon from the 6th & 7th Chapters of the Book Of Judges whom God chose 300 men for Gideon to fight against the war of the Midianites. That night 300 Christians came together, unconcerned of their separate ways they practiced their faith; but focused on the commonality they had in Christ, and their desire to pray for the needs of others. The following year, Pastor Brian and his wife met Mr Jones. All he had to offer him was forty cents and an apology for not being able to do more. His reply is what sparked the mission now known as Chosen 300... "But you considered me..." Today, over 115 religious organizations, companies and community groups distribute over 150,000 full course meals throughout the Philadelphia region. Chosen 300 also provides more than 500,000 lbs of food and humanitarian aid in 24 locations across 9 countries. Brian never saw Mr. Jones again, but stated, "I see the smile he had on his face that night every time I see the smile of another homeless person we reach."										</p>
