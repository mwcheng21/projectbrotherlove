        <h3>This year's theme is: How to be the proof of God's Love</h3>
        <p>"19 We love because he first loved us. 20 If anyone says, “I love God,” and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen. 21 And this commandment we have from him: whoever loves God must also love his brother."	-1 John 4:19-21(ESV)
