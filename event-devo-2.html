    <div><h2>Devotional Day 2 - Salvation through faith</h2>
        <p><strong>“For by grace you have been saved through faith”</strong>
				</p>
        <br>
        <p>
          <i>Romans 10:9 “if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.”
          <br>
          <br>
James 2:18-19 But someone will say, “You have faith and I have works.” Show me your faith apart from your works, and I will show you my faith by my works. You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe—and shudder!</i>
<br>
<br>
There are many “faiths” in the world. People believe in all kinds of things and gods. The Bible tells us that there is a faith that saves. It’s a response to the grace we talked about yesterday.
