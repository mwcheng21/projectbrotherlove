    <div><h2>Devotional Day 1 - Grace is an expensive gift</h2>

          Some people use an acronym to remember this: God’s Riches At Christ’ Expense.
This means that Christ paid the price for us (on the cross, by willingly dying and paying the debt for all of us). The price is an eternity of punishment. This is like some neighbor you don’t even like telling you, “the government showed us at your door the other day when you weren’t home. Turns out they fined you $100 million dollars, but don’t worry, I paid it for you. You don’t owe me anything.”
A debt you could not pay from someone you either despised or ignored all your life. This was not cheap or easy for God to do, but He offers it freely.
