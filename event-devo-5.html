        <p><strong>“For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works”</strong>

We often think about what we want to do with our life. But that assumes we are our own master and can decide what we want to do. This verse reminds us that a) Jesus Christ created us b) that He created us individually and c) that we have a purpose given by Him. 
Our life on this earth is not random and although we can’t see what’s ahead, there’s a plan. If you’re a child of God, it’s a good plan. God put you in His plan and wants you there. You’re not an accident. It’s like all of the universe is a puzzle and while you’re a small puzzle piece, every piece is there for a reason. You may have a general idea about what the reason is (like glorifying God), but you won’t know the specific reason(s) until you get to heaven. So other people (parents, bosses, the government) may have a plan for you and your life but only God can put His plan into action for good and for eternity.
