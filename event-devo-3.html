        <p><strong>“not a result of works, so that no one may boast.”</strong>

          <i>Is 64:6 "We have all become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous deeds are like a polluted garment. We all fade like a leaf, and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away."</i>"

“Unclean” is not a word we use these days. Perhaps the more modern analogy would be to be infected with the T-virus like a zombie. No one wants to be near you. That’s the way God feels about our sin and us without Jesus Christ. Even if a zombie does something good, it’s still a zombie. That’s the way God feels about our “good works” apart from a relationship with Him.

      <li>What good works do you do and why?</li>
      <li>
        Can these or anything else you do save you or make you more likeable to God?
</li>
      <li>Will you ever be good enough to God?</li>
